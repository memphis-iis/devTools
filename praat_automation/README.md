# Installing Python on Windows and Using Praat Automation for UNGA Audio

Note, you must place Praat.exe and the contents of this folder into the working directory, along side the mp3 audio files to analyze.

To run Python scripts on Windows, you'll need to install Python. Here's how to do it:

## Step 1: Download Python

1. Visit the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Click on the "Downloads" tab and select the latest version of Python for Windows. It's recommended to choose a version with a stable release.

3. Scroll down and choose the installer that matches your system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit). Most modern Windows systems use 64-bit, but you can check your system type by right-clicking "This PC" or "My Computer" and selecting "Properties."

4. Click on the installer to download it. The file name should be something like `python-X.X.X-amd64.exe` for 64-bit or `python-X.X.X.exe` for 32-bit.

## Step 2: Install Python

1. Run the downloaded installer by double-clicking the `.exe` file.

2. Check the box that says "Add Python X.X to PATH" during installation. This will make it easier to run Python from the command line.

3. Click "Install Now" to begin the installation process.

4. Wait for the installation to complete. Once it's finished, you'll see a message that Python has been successfully installed.

## Step 3: Verify Python Installation

To make sure Python is installed correctly, open the Windows Command Prompt:

1. Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog.

2. Type `cmd` and press Enter to open the Command Prompt.

3. In the Command Prompt, type the following command and press Enter:

# Installing Required Python Modules

The scripts require pyautogui and pywin32

1. Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog.

2. Type `cmd` and press Enter to open the Command Prompt.

3. In the Command Prompt, type the following command and press Enter:

`python -m pip install pyautogui`

`python -m pip install pywin32`

# Running Python Scripts

Now that you have Python installed, you can run your Python scripts.

## Running `mass_rename.py`


1. Open the Command Prompt

2. Navigate to the working directory where `mass_rename.py` is located using the `cd` command.

3. Run the script by typing the following command and pressing Enter:

`python mass_rename.py`


Replace `mass_rename.py` with the actual filename if it's different.

## Running `run.py`

Similarly, to run a script called `run.py`:

1. Open the Command Prompt.

2. Navigate to the working directory where `run.py` is located using the `cd` command.

3. Run the script by typing the following command and pressing Enter:
