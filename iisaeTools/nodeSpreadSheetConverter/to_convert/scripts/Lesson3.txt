Cristina: _user_ riend ,and Jordan, welcome back.
Cristina: Let's take some time to review affixes. Affixes are added to words to change their meaning. They can be prefixes or suffixes.
Jordan: Cristina, could you give examples of prefixes and suffixes? I don't know much about them.
Cristina: Suffixes are letters or words added to the end of words to change their meaning. For example, if we look at the word government, ment, is changing the meaning of govern.
Cristina: Let's look at an example. Here is the root word, cover.
Cristina: If we add the prefix, un, it changes the meaning of the word to the opposite of cover.
Cristina: If we add the suffix, ed, it changes the meaning of the word to indicate something that has already happened.
Cristina: Here it is in a sentence. The detective uncovered evidence that solved the case.
Jordan: Can I try it?
Cristina: Jordan, Sure you can.
Jordan: I would like to use the root word, test.
Cristina: Ok, what affix could you add to the word test and how would that change the meaning of the root word.
Jordan: I could add the prefix, re-, to tell the reader that the test is being taken again.
Cristina: Can you think of another type of affix to add to change the meaning again?
Jordan: I can add the suffix, ing, to tell the reader that the test is being taken right now.
Cristina: OK, can you use that in a sentence?
Jordan: How about this? The class did not do well on the first test so they are retesting today
Cristina: That sounds good. Let's practice some more with affixes."
