Cristina: _user_ and Jordan Hello    
Jordan: Hello again Cristina.     
Cristina: Two day we are going to practice identifying the correct definition for multiple meaning words.     
Jordan: Oh ok. Let me think. This would be an example of a multiple meaning word. Right? Because ring can mean different things in different sentences.    
Cristina: Jordan That's right. In the first sentence, it is a verb that means to sound in a reverberating way and in the second sentence it means a circular object. So, how do you think we identify the correct definition of the word if it was used in a sentence?     
Jordan: I remember this. First we will stop and label the word that is confusing us because it has more than one meaning.    
Cristina: Jordan Great! Next, we reread and clarify the word by asking ourselves what the word means in that specific sentence. Finally, we replace the multiple meaning word with different definitions and check which one makes the most sense.     
Jordan: Cool. So how will we use this strategy in this lesson?     
Cristina: _user_, A sentence will appear at the top of the screen. A multiple meaning word will be underlined in the sentence. You will need to pick the correct definition for the multiple meaning word.    
Jordan: And we just click one of the buttons to select an option right?     
Cristina: Yep, exactly. _user_, Jordan will take a turn after you and we will keep track of how both of you do with a scoreboard at the bottom of the screen.     
Jordan: Great, let's get started then!
