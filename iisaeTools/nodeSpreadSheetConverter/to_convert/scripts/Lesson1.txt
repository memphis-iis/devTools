Cristina: _user_ Hi. I'm happy you are joining us for this lesson! My name is Cristina and I will be your tutor throughout this program.
Jordan: _user_, hello! I'm Jordan! I will be here learning with you! I'm happy you are here to learn with me.
Cristina: In this lesson we will show you how to identify print and visual cues, titles and subtitles. Also, how to make predictions using these signals.
Jordan: Cristina, Can you explain what these text signals are? 
Cristina: Yes. Take a look at this book. You can see the title of the book, Ending Back Pain; in green. the visual cue of a person suffering from back pain is in yellow. and the subtitle of the book is in blue.
Jordan: I got it. So the title gives us general information, the visual cue is related to the topic of the book, and the subtitle shows us more information about the topic. Can we get started?
Cristina: Yes, lets start. But first, I should tell you that as we go along in the lessons, you may notice that two buttons appear at the bottom left of your screen.
Cristina: These are a repeat button and a video button. You can press the repeat button if you need to hear something again. You can press the video button if you would like to review the video that highlights the lessons main points.
Cristina: now, I think we are ready. For this activity you will need to select the print cues or visual cues that complete the book cover or street sign.
Cristina: From there you will have to make predictions about the material. Let's look over the current book cover and take note of the different text signals. When you are ready, please click on the continue button to start the activity.
