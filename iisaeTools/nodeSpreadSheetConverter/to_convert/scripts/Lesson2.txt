Cristina: _user_ and Jordan, hello it's Cristina. I could really use your help with placing these books on the correct ‘purpose cart’.
Jordan: Good to see you again, Cristina. What exactly would we need to do?
Cristina: You two will have to predict the writer’s purpose for each book. Then click on the ‘purpose cart’ where you think the book belongs.
Jordan: Oh I see. We have to place the books on the right cart according to the author's purpose. Sounds simple.
Jordan: _user_, let's have a little competition to see who place the most books in the correct 'purpose cart. ' Are you ready? Let's go!
